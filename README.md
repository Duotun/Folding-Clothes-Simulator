# Folding-Clothes-Simulator
Folding Clothes Task with Physics-based Simulation

The real-time cloth simulation is mainly based on Obi Package: http://obi.virtualmethodstudio.com/

We achieved model smooth method and added more strict distance and rotation constraints on generated clothes. 
Two-sided shader was developed for rendering clothes model in Unity. All the clothes model were created in Maya.

Two folding ways were achived:
1.  s
2. s
